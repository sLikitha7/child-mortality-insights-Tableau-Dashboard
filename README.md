 **Global Neonatal Mortality Analysis**  

---

###  Overview  
This project explores global neonatal mortality trends using **SQL, Pandas, Excel, and Tableau** based on World Bank Development Indicators. It highlights the correlation between economic growth (**GDP per capita**) and neonatal death rates, providing valuable insights for health policymakers, researchers, and data enthusiasts.  

---

###  **Key Features**  
- **Global Neonatal Mortality Dashboard** – Visualizes neonatal deaths over time with interactive filtering.  
- **Economic Growth vs. Child Mortality** – Explores how increasing GDP impacts neonatal survival rates.  
- **Turkey's Neonatal Health Journey** – Analyzes Turkey’s progress in reducing neonatal deaths from 1990 onward.  
- **Dynamic Visualizations** – Allows users to compare trends by country, region, and income group.  
- **SQL-Powered Data Processing** – Extracted, transformed, and preprocessed large datasets efficiently.  
- **Pandas for Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, normalized GDP/mortality metrics, and ensured data consistency.  
- **Excel for Initial Data Handling** – Used for preliminary data exploration, formatting, and validation.

###  **Insights**  
 **Neonatal deaths are declining globally**, but disparities exist across income groups.  
 **Higher GDP per capita correlates with lower neonatal mortality rates**, highlighting the importance of economic stability.  
 **Turkey’s neonatal mortality dropped significantly after 2002**, influenced by economic stability and healthcare improvements.  

---

###  **Future Scope**  
 **Adding machine learning models** to predict neonatal mortality rates.  
 **Enhancing country-specific case studies** with more granular data.  
 **Publishing dashboards on Tableau Public** for wider accessibility.  

---

###  **Why This Matters**  
Understanding **child mortality trends** is crucial for policymakers and organizations working on **global health initiatives**. This project provides **data-driven insights** to help drive action toward reducing **infant mortality worldwide**.
