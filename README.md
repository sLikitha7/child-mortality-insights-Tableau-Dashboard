Overview:

This project explores global neonatal mortality trends using Tableau visualizations based on World Bank Development Indicators. It highlights the correlation between economic growth (GDP per capita) and neonatal death rates, providing valuable insights for health policymakers, researchers, and data enthusiasts.

🔍 Key Features

✅ Global Neonatal Mortality Dashboard – Visualizes neonatal deaths over time with interactive filtering.
✅ Economic Growth vs. Child Mortality – Explores how increasing GDP impacts neonatal survival rates.
✅ Turkey's Neonatal Health Journey – Analyzes Turkey’s progress in reducing neonatal deaths from 1990 onward.
✅ Dynamic Visualizations – Allows users to compare trends by country, region, and income group.

Insights

Neonatal deaths are declining globally but disparities exist across income groups.
Higher GDP per capita correlates with lower neonatal mortality rates.
Turkey’s neonatal mortality dropped significantly after 2002, influenced by economic stability and healthcare improvements.

Future Scope

📌 Adding machine learning predictions for neonatal mortality rates.
📌 Enhancing country-specific case studies.
📌 Publishing dashboards on Tableau Public for wider access.

Why This Matters
Understanding child mortality trends is crucial for policymakers and organizations working on global health initiatives. This project aims to provide data-driven insights to help drive action towards reducing infant mortality worldwide.
