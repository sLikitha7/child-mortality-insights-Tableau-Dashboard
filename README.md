🌍📊 **Global Neonatal Mortality Analysis**  

---

### 📌 Overview  
This project explores global neonatal mortality trends using **SQL, Pandas, Excel, and Tableau** based on World Bank Development Indicators. It highlights the correlation between economic growth (**GDP per capita**) and neonatal death rates, providing valuable insights for health policymakers, researchers, and data enthusiasts.

### 🎯 **Key Features**  
✅ **Global Neonatal Mortality Dashboard** – Visualizes neonatal deaths over time with interactive filtering.  
✅ **Economic Growth vs. Child Mortality** – Explores how increasing GDP impacts neonatal survival rates.  
✅ **Turkey's Neonatal Health Journey** – Analyzes Turkey’s progress in reducing neonatal deaths from 1990 onward.  
✅ **Dynamic Visualizations** – Allows users to compare trends by country, region, and income group.  
✅ **SQL-Powered Data Processing** – Extracted, transformed, and preprocessed large datasets efficiently.  
✅ **Pandas for Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, normalized GDP/mortality metrics, and ensured data consistency.  
✅ **Excel for Initial Data Handling** – Used for preliminary data exploration, formatting, and validation.
